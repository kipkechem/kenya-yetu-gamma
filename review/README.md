# Review Folder

This directory contains files that were identified as obsolete or redundant during the restructuring of the KenyaYetu application. 

- **Components**: Old page components that were located in `src/components` have been moved to `src/pages` with updated import paths.
- **Data**: Flat data files from `src/data` have been organized into specific subdirectories (e.g., `data/legislation`, `data/governance`) to improve maintainability.
- **Root Files**: Obsolete root-level components like `ConstitutionExplorer.tsx` (which now resides in `pages/`) are stored here.

These files are kept for archival purposes and reference but are not active in the current build.
