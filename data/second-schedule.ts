(b) THE NATIONAL ANTHEM
Ee Mungu Nguvu Yetu (O God of all creation)
1. Ee Mungu nguvu yetu, Ilete baraka kwetu. Haki iwe ngao na mlinzi, Natukae na undugu, Amani na uhuru, Raha tupate na ustawi.
2. Amkeni ndugu zetu, Tufanye sote bidii, Nasi tujitoe kwa nguvu, Nchi yetu ya Kenya, Tunayoipenda, Tuwe tayari kuilinda.
3. Natujenge taifa letu, Ee, ndio wajibu wetu, Kenya istahili heshima, Tuungane mikono, Pamoja kazini, Kila siku tuwe na shukrani.

English Translation:
1. O God of all creation, Bless this our land and nation. Justice be our shield and defender, May we dwell in unity, Peace and liberty, Plenty be found within our borders.
2. Let one and all arise, With hearts both strong and true. Service be our earnest endeavour, And our Homeland of Kenya, Heritage of splendour, Firm may we stand to defend.
3. Let all with one accord, In common bond united, Build this our nation together, And the glory of Kenya, The fruit of our labour, Fill every heart with thanksgiving.

(c) THE COAT OF ARMS
The Coat of Arms of Kenya features two lions, a symbol of protection, holding spears and a traditional Maasai shield. The shield and spears symbolise unity and defence of freedom. The shield contains the national colours, representing:
Black for the people of Kenya.
Green for the agriculture and natural resources.
Red for the struggle for freedom.
White for unity and peace.
The shield is divided by a red band containing a rooster, which according to local customs, represents a new and prosperous life. The shield and lions stand on a silhouette of Mount Kenya containing in the foreground examples of Kenya's agricultural produce - coffee, pyrethrum, sisal, tea, maize and pineapples. The scroll supporting the lions has the word 'Harambee', which means 'pulling together'.

The Public Seal is the seal of the Republic of Kenya, used to authenticate official documents and communications of the State.`
